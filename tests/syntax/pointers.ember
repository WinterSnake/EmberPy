// Initialization
*int32    a;  // Pointer to an int32
**int32   b;  // Pointer to a pointer to an int32
*int32[5] c;  // Array of 5 int32 pointers

// Setup
uint16   d = 10;
*uint16  e = &d;  // Pointer to uint16 (address of 'd')
**uint16 f = &e;  // Pointer to a pointer to an uint16 (address of 'e')
*uint16  g = *f;  // Pointer to uint16 (dereference 'f')
uint16   h = *g;  // uint16 (dereference 'g')
